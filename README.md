# OAuth 2.0 Client for webtrees
A [webtrees](https://webtrees.net) 2.1 custom module to provide [OAuth 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth) single sign on ([SSO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on)) with OAuth 2.0 authorization providers.

## What are the benefits of this module?
+ The module provides single sign on ([SSO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on)) into the webtrees application based on the [OAuth 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth) standard.
+ A pre-configured set of authorization providers can be selected during webtrees login.
+ If using sign on with an authorization provider, the user account data (i.e. name, user name, email) from the authorization provider is used in webtrees.

## IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTES
It is **highly recommended to use** the **HTTPS** protocol for your webtrees installations. The [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS) protocol will ensure the encryption of the communication between webtrees and the authorization provider for a secure exchange of secret IDs and secret access tokens.

Please check whether your **webtrees BASE_URL** in the config.ini.php file **starts with "https"**, e.g. https://my_site.net/webtrees.

## Installation
+ Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Jefferson49/webtrees-oauth2-client/releases/latest) of the module
+ Copy the folder "oauth2_client" into the "module_v4" folder of your webtrees installation
+ Check if the module is activated in the control panel:
  + Login to webtrees as an administrator
	+ Go to "Control Panel/All Modules", and find the module called "ExtendedImportExport"
	+ Check if it has a tick for "Enabled"

## Supported Authorization Providers
Currently, the following authorization providers are supported:
+ Generic (can be configured for several authorization providers)
+ Github
+ Google
+ Joomla (with a specific authorization provider installed in Joomla)

## Configuration of Authorization Providers
### General Configuration
In general, the following steps need to be taken to configure an authorization provider:
+ Login on the provider web page
+ Register an OAuth2 app (or web app)
+ Provide the **redirect URL** (or callback URL) for the registered app
+ Get the **client ID** for the registered app
+ Get (or generate) the **client secret** for the registered app
+ Enter the client ID and client secret into your webtrees configuratin file (config.ini.php)

Use the following value as redirect or callback URL with BASE_URL from your webtrees config.ini.php (base_url="xxx"):
```
BASE_URL/index.php?route=/webtrees/OAuth2Client
```

In the following, the configuration is described for a subset of authorization providers. Simular configuration procedures apply to other providers. 

### Generic
+ Configure the OAuth 2.0 server, which shall be used as authorization provider
+ Configure the "Redirect URL" to webtrees within the OAuth 2.0 server:
    + URL: **BASE_URL/index.php?route=/webtrees/OAuth2Client** (BASE_URL from webtrees config.ini.php; base_url='...')
+ Create and check the "Client ID", and "Client Secret" within the OAuth 2.0 server
+ Open your webtrees config.ini.php file and insert the following lines:
```PHP
Generic_clientId='xxx'
Joomla_clientSecret='xxx'
Generic_urlAuthorize='xxx'
Generic_urlAccessToken='xxx'
Generic_urlResourceOwnerDetails='xxx'
Generic_loginButtonLabel='xxx'
```
+ Insert the configuration details from the OAuth 2.0 Server into the newly included configuration lines of your config.ini.php file:
    + **Generic_clientId**='...' (value from the OAuth 2.0 Server)
    + **Generic_clientSecret**='...' (value from the OAuth 2.0 Server)
    + **Generic_urlAuthorize**='...' (value from the OAuth 2.0 Server)
    + **Generic_urlAccessToken**='...' (value from the OAuth 2.0 Server)

## Webtrees Version
The module was developed and tested with [webtrees 2.1.20](https://webtrees.net/download), but should also run with any other 2.1 version.

## Translation
You can help to translate this module. The translation is based on [gettext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettext) and uses .po files, which can be found in [/resources/lang/](https://github.com/Jefferson49/webtrees-oauth2-client/tree/main/resources/lang). You can use a local editor like [Poedit](https://poedit.net/) or notepad++ to work on translations and provide them in the [Github repository](https://github.com/Jefferson49/webtrees-oauth2-client) of the module. You can do this via a pull request (if you know how to do), or by opening a new issue and attaching a .po file. Updated translations will be included in the next release of this module.
